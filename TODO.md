# Nouman Kids Wear — Task List

Organized by priority. Complete Phase 1 before launch. Phase 2 can be iterative post-launch.

---

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes & Polish (Pre-Launch)

### 1. Fix Splash Video ⚠️
**File**: `src/components/common/SplashScreen.tsx`  
**Issue**: Video not playing on mount  
**Possible causes**:
- Browser autoplay policy blocking (needs `muted` + `playsInline`)
- Video path incorrect
- `autoPlay` prop not set correctly
- Video format compatibility (MP4 should work)

**Action**:
- Verify video file path: `/brand/nouman-logo-splash.mp4`
- Ensure `autoPlay`, `muted`, `playsInline` all set
- Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- Add error handling (`onError` callback)

---

### 2. Fix Hero Background Image ⚠️
**File**: `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx`  
**Issue**: Background image not visible  
**Possible causes**:
- Parent container missing `position: relative`
- Next Image with `fill` needs explicit parent sizing
- Gradient overlay too opaque (hiding image)
- Image path incorrect
- `priority` prop missing (lazy load blocking initial paint)

**Action**:
- Verify image path: `/hero/nouman-hero-bg.png`
- Check parent container has `relative` positioning
- Test gradient opacity values (reduce from/via values)
- Ensure `fill` + `sizes="100vw"` set correctly
- Add `priority` prop for above-fold image

---

### 3. Fix New Arrivals Auto-Transition ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/components/sections/HeroNewArrivals.tsx`  
**Status**: Carousel now auto-advances every 1.8 seconds  
**Completed**:
- Fixed interval reference management with `intervalRef`
- Improved embla API initialization check
- Changed from `canScrollNext()` to loop back to start
- Cleaned up event handlers for pause/resume on hover/focus
- Shows exactly 4 new arrivals as specified
- Auto-transition pauses when user hovers or focuses on carousel
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference

---

### 4. Improve Brand Title/Logo Lockup ✅ COMPLETED
**File**: `src/components/sections/Hero.tsx` (lines ~60–75)  
**Status**: Brand title significantly larger and more prominent  
**Completed**:
- Mobile: Increased from `text-[2.4rem]` to `text-[2.8rem]` (17% larger)
- Desktop: Added `lg:text-[4rem]` for even more impact on large screens
- Logo sizes adjusted: `size-14 sm:size-16 lg:size-20` (better balanced)
- Improved spacing throughout hero section
- Better mobile responsiveness

---

### 5. UI Polish & Refinement ✅ COMPLETED
**Files**: All section and card components  
**Status**: Mobile-first optimization with better spacing and typography

**Completed**:
- **Mobile-first spacing**: Reduced from `px-4 pb-12` to `px-3.5 pb-10` (20% tighter on mobile)
- **Section headings**: Scale properly from `text-xl` → `sm:text-2xl` → `lg:text-3xl`
- **Product grid**: Tighter gaps on mobile (`gap-3` vs `gap-3.5`)
- **Product cards**: Smaller text and padding on mobile, scales up on larger screens
- **Category grid**: Optimized 2-column layout with `gap-2` on mobile
- **Typography**: All text scales gradually (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44px height for all buttons
- **Hero section**: Comprehensive mobile optimization (see #4 above)

**Mobile-first principles applied**:
- Base styles target 375px width (smallest common iPhone)
- Spacing and typography scale UP from mobile baseline
- No desktop-first retrofitting with `max-` classes
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Content-first approach (decorative elements hidden on mobile)

---

### 6. Verify Mobile Layout 📱
**Files**: All components  
**Goal**: Perfect mobile experience (most users browse on phone)

**Actions**:
- Test at 375px, 390px, 414px widths (common mobile sizes)
- Check touch target sizes (min 44px height for buttons)
- Verify horizontal scroll works for category chips
- Test sticky header doesn't cover content
- Ensure images don't cause horizontal overflow
- Check text remains readable (no tiny fonts)
- Test mobile menu Sheet (right slide-in, proper close behavior)

---

### 7. Run Production Build ✅
**Command**: `npm run build`  
**Goal**: Catch type errors, build warnings, optimization issues

**Actions**:
- Fix any TypeScript errors
- Resolve ESLint warnings
- Check for unused imports
- Verify no `console.log` left in production code
- Ensure build completes without errors
- Test production build locally: `npm run start`

---

## Phase 2: Content & Deployment (Post-Development)
